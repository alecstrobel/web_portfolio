      <h4 class="leading-7">Iâ€™m a designer at heart. Always have been. Iâ€™ve always seen the world around me as endless possibilities. Endless things to create and problems to solve. Since the products we use day to day shape our lives, Iâ€™m convinced product design is my means to making a difference in the world.

Iâ€™m from the United States, but have lived most of my life in Europe, which has had a profound impact on my life and character. I started down the path of product design while studying Design Management at the University of the Arts London.

I currently specialise in user experience design, but Iâ€™m in love with the entire design process of digital products and Iâ€˜m looking to grow further in that direction.</h4>
